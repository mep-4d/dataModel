# dataModel

Semantic sense-making, for modern smart buildings. 

This repository is designed to give guidance to the design of smart enabled buildings. MSI's/SI's and control sysem vendors should use it to name devices, points and parameters accross all their systems and application developers should use it to identify the mechanism for binding the the data they need.

While there are many emerging models and solutions already well established in the building technology sector, most of them are either overly complicated and fail in their core objectives or do not contain the basic elements of building systems data resulting in a high degree of augmentation from the base model.

This toolset aims to simplify the smart enablement journey.
